## EventSourcing.Net.Engine

This package contains the EventsSourcing.Net engine. It has no dependencies on third-party NuGet packages.

However, it might be easier to use the [EventSourcing.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EventSourcing.Net/) package, which provides extension methods for configuring and running EventSourcing.Net with the standard .net DI.
